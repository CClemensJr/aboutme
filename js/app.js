//HTML
// Convert my biographical elements into unordered elements
// Consider adopting additional features that I have seen in the 'About Me' projects made by others, so that my 'About Me' can become more thorough and interesting than my original conception.
// Make myself more personable by adding a Top Ten list to the bottom of my About Me page with an ordered list in HTML, for instance, my Top Ten Favorite Movies or my Top Ten Places I Want to Visit, or something along those lines.
// Per the user stories, you will need to include in your HTML at least one each of an ordered and an unordered list.
// Move the guessing game to a separate HTML file, list the questions on the page, and then have the answers fill in on the page after the user provides the answers.

// Consider the user experience (UX) of my About Me and guessing game, trying to view it through the eyes of a user.

// have five yes/no questions in my "about me" guessing game so that I have enough questions to cover a variety of things about me
// Add a sixth question to my guessing game that takes numeric input by prompting a user to guess a number (for instance, "What is my favorite number?" or "How many Pok√©mon did I catch this week?"), and indicates to the user whether the guess is "too high" or "too low", and gives the user exactly four opportunities to get the correct answer
// Add a seventh question to my guessing game that has multiple possible correct answers that are stored in an array (for instance, "Can you guess a state that I have lived in besides Washington?"), so that even more of my programming skills are showcased. For now, I will structure this question so that the user has six tries to get a single correct answer, and upon using up those tries OR getting a correct answer, displays a message to the user indicating all of the possible correct answers
// keep a tally of the total number of correct answers given by the user, and at the end of the game, tell the user how well they did with a personalized custom message that includes the number of correct answers and also addresses the user by name, e.g. "You got 4 out of 7 questions correct, Bobbi! Better luck next time.
// Make my code more DRY by putting all of the questions, answers, and responses to the first five yes/no questions in my guessing game into arrays (or even one huge multidimensional array), and modifying the game logic such that a 'for' loop will control the flow from question to question.
// Make the number-guessing question use a random number as its correct answer.
// Move the guessing game to a separate HTML file, list the questions on the page, and then have the answers fill in on the page after the user provides the answers.
// Use promptfor input and alert for output to the user, unless you are working on the third Stretch Goal.
// Do not write any functions in your JavaScript.
// Expect that you will probably need both 'for' and 'while' structures for your sixth and seventh questions. But not necessarily.
